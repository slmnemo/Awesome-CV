\begin{cvletter}

\lettersection{Why Lucid?}
As an engineer who specifically chose her college to make sure she understood the impact of her work, I have a huge interest in applying my skills to make the modern climate crisis we are currently experiencing just a little bit better. From the perspective of electrical engineering, the idea of working with batteries to electrify things that are currently emitting carbon has particularly grasped me in recent times. I don't have much experience working with microcontrollers, mostly just what I've done in my classes with C and Python, but I do have extensive experience working with digital designs in general. I'm willing to pick up skills to get up to speed quickly with an embedded team, and I know I can pick up those skills quickly. I think I would be a great fit at Lucid, as it would allow me to use my skills to help decarbonize the future.

\lettersection{About Me}
I am a woman who loves electronics, computers, and public transit. In the past, I have worked on mainly low voltage electronics projects such as graphics cards and microcontrollers. In addition, I run a small Linux server for myself to use for file transfer and running tasks while I'm gone. Outside of my interests, I like to play games where the focus is on collaboration and on building systems to do things such as Factorio. In past jobs I have been called a very hard worker and described as intelligent, delivering work that requires a technical background not found in the average person.
