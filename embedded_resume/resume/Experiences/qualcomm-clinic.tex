      \item{
      Worked with a team of five students to analyze RTL projects to determine when a design would fail to close PPA constraints in logic synthesis.
      }
      \item{
      Generated AND-Inverter graphs using the open source CAD tool Yosys/ABC to extract features correlated with
      reactivity to synthesis constraints.
      }
      \item{
      Analyzed and extracted features from generated graphs in Python to predict when a design might react a lot to
      different PPA constraints.
      }
      \item {
      Developed an optimized custom implementation of DAG topological sort to determine top-level source nodes for any given node in the graph, speeding up analysis by a factor of 100x.
      }
      \item {
      Predicted module reactivity to PPA constraints during synthesis of HDL modules with an accuracy of 89\%.
      }
