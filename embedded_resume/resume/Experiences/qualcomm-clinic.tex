      \item{
      Worked with a team of four students to analyze RTL projects to determine when an RTL design caused extra processing effort in logic synthesis by synthesizing many open source designs.
      }
      \item{
      Generated AND-Inverter graphs using the open source CAD tool Yosys/ABC to extract features which were correlated with poor synthesis performance.
      }
      \item{
      Analyzed graphs in Python using NetworkX to analyze AIGs for use in a Machine Learning pipeline to detect whether a design would cause extra processing effort.
      }
      \item {
      Developed a speed-optimized custom implementation of DAG topological sort in Python to determine top-level source node for any given node in the graph, speeding up analysis by a factor of 100x.
      }
