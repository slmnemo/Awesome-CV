        \item {
        Developed a custom RF testbench using Python and MATLAB to characterize radio frequency response bands.
        }
        \item {
        Designed from the ground up a netlist parser to create graphs out of transistor designs, speeding up detection of transistors causing clock skew.
        }
        \item {
        Automated phase calibration of multi-antenna radios using an RF testbench, allowing for production of phase-calibrated radios.
