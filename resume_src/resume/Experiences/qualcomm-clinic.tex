      \item{
      Worked with a team of five students to analyze RTL projects to determine when a design would fail to close PPA constraints in logic synthesis.
      }
      \item{
      Generated AND-Inverter graphs of Verilog Projects using the open source CAD tool Yosys/ABC to analyze features correlated with poor synthesis performance using Machine Learning with an accuracy of 89\%.
      }
      \item {
      Optimized a DAG topological sort implementation to determine top-level source nodes for any node in the graph, speeding up analysis by 100x.
